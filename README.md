# README

### A small script I wrote to automate the creation of my standard project folders.

Copy and paste the file into one of your PATH directories and make sure that the shebang is pointing correctly to the Python executable on your system.

You should then be able to run the script from your terminal.

### Two Versions

There is a version that works with Python3 and another that only works with Python2.

I haven't tested to see if the Python3 version would work in Python2 though.

### For the Future

I would like to expand the app so that it can take arguments or terminal input to further customize the folder tree that it creates, based on the kind of project I am starting.
